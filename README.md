# simple-unit-converter
this is my second simple, small, stupid, ugly project I make, I hope you guys gonna tell the project you want me to make in C
oh right, to use it you can type 1 to convert a number from meter to centimeter and 2 for meter per second to kilometer per hour
maybe my next project is an calculator in but it will show the solution to solve to answer
